  The DeversiFi API allows trading of cryptocurrency tokens from an Ethereum wallet or smart-contract.
The available endpoints allow access to submit, cancel and query placed orders onto the DeversiFi order book, whilst keeping full custody of funds and authenticating only using an Ethereum account. By using this API anyone is able to create and integrate their own interfaces, or run trading algorithms whilst keeping secure control of their funds in a personal Ethereum wallet.

  The DeversiFi APIs can be interacted with directly as described by the endpoint documentation available on https://docs.beta.deversifi.com/ or via a client library. The dvf-client-js library simplifies the interaction with the exchange and helps you get started quicker. The library itself and tutorial on how to use it can be found on the DeversiFi Github - https://github.com/DeversiFi/
